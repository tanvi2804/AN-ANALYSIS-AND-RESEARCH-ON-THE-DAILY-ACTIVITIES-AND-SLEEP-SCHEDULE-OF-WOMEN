## Introduction 🏃‍♀️

The main task of this project is to analyze data from fitness trackers to understand the psychosocial influences on women's participation in physical activity and how it affects their sleep schedule.

## Problem Statement ❓

Women face various challenges in maintaining an active lifestyle, such as scarcity of time, less sleep, perceptions of safety, household care, and parenting demands.

## Dataset 📊

The dataset includes data tracked from smart devices, focusing on daily activities and sleep schedules of women.

## Data Analysis 🔍

Analysis of the tracked data revealed that:
- A higher average of non-active minutes tends to correlate with a higher average BMI.
- More time spent non-active negatively impacts sleep quality.
- Higher active minutes are associated with more calories burned in a day.

## Data Visualization 📈

Various visualizations were created to understand the relationship between activity levels, sleep quality, and BMI.

## Solution 💡

The study proposes combining a tracker and holistic health coach specifically for women, focusing on:
- Exploring their activity tracking in the app.
- Altering high numbers of sedentary minutes.
- Comparing the relation between high sedentary minutes and BMI to promote an active lifestyle.
- Implementing a sleep tracking function.

## Interesting Findings 🤔

More steps per day do not always lead to more sleep or more calories burned. Achieving fitness goals does not always require hitting "10,000" steps.

## Challenges 🚧

Limitations exist due to the sample size and absence of key characteristics of the participants. The running distance is not accurately recorded, and the data is not all-inclusive.

## Conclusion 🏁

The analysis showed a clear trend that non-active individuals tend to have a negative lifestyle. Promoting an active lifestyle and improving sleep quality are crucial for overall well-being.
